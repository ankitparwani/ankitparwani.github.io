## Experience

Vihanga EmbedSoft Dec 2021 – July 2022
Software Test Engineer Bengaluru, Karnataka
• I was Involved in low-level testing related to Cockpit avionics on various related modules.

## Projects

1. Heart Disease Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
• Conducted in-depth analysis of a heart disease dataset using Python libraries (Pandas,
Seaborn, Matplotlib).
• Visualized data distributions and relationships with various plots: DistPlot for age
distribution, Pie Charts for categorical variables (gender), ViolinPlots for gender
comparison in heart disease prevalence, and correlation analysis using Heatmaps, Pair
Plots, and Joint Plots.
• Identified key trends and relationships such as age range (40-70) being most affected and
the gender disparity in heart disease risk (higher prevalence in males).
• Gained insights into variable interactions, which helped shape further statistical modeling
and hypothesis testing.

2. GDP Analysis
• Conducted a detailed analysis of global GDP data using Pandas, Plotly, and NumPy to
calculate and visualize GDP growth rates over time.
• Analyzed trends in GDP across countries and regions, comparing key economies like
India and China.
• Utilized interactive visualizations in Plotly to effectively communicate findings,
including country-specific comparisons of GDP growth.
• Gained insights into economic trends, highlighting China’s faster GDP growth
compared to India over the years.

3. Sales Data Analysis Project
• Performed in-depth sales data analysis using Excel functions (SUM, AVERAGE,
COUNTIF, UNIQUE, SORT) to calculate total sales, average monthly sales, and identify
high-performing products.
• Utilized Pivot Tablesfor multi-dimensional analysis, enabling insights into sales trends
by product, month, and region.
• Applied advanced Excel features like calculated fields for in-depth insights, such as
forecasting sales and categorizing product performance.
• Generated actionable business insights for data-driven decision-making by exploring
sales trends and product profitability across regions and time periods.

4. Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard Project
• Developed an interactive dashboard using Python and Tableau to analyze sales data
from a fictional superstore.
• Focused on key metrics like sales, profit, discount, and region-wise performance.
• Identified top-performing categories and products, and highlighted underperforming
regions for business improvement.
• Enabled filtering based on product type, region, and time period, providing insights
to inform strategic decisions.

5. YouTube Scraper Project
• Developed a web scraper using Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and NumPy to
extract video data from YouTube channels.
• Scraped key data points such as video title, views, likes, upload date, description, and
thumbnail links from a specified YouTube channel.
• Automated navigation through video links and performed in-depth data extraction
from each video page.
• Saved the scraped data into a structured CSV file, enabling further analysis.
• Demonstrated skills in web scraping, data manipulation, and automation.

6. Solar Irradiance Prediction
• Developed predictive models to estimate solar irradiance based on meteorological
data from the HI-SEAS weather station (September–December 2016).
• Performed data wrangling: split date fields, extracted sunrise/sunset hours, and
dropped unnecessary features for dataset simplification.
• Conducted feature selection using correlation matrices, SelectKBest, and Extra Trees
Classifier to identify significant predictors.
• Applied feature engineering techniques, including BoxCox, MinMax, and standard
transformations to prepare data for modeling.
• Implemented XGBoost and multilayer perceptron models to predict solar radiation.

7. Face Detection and Manipulation
• Developed a Python application for real-time face detection and manipulation using
OpenCV and Haar cascades.
• Implemented techniques for detecting faces in images and videos, allowing for
dynamic interactions with detected features.
• Applied image processing operations to enhance facial attributes, demonstrating the
integration of computer vision in practical applications.
• Explored various use cases, including security systems and entertainment, showcasing
versatility in the field of facial recognition technology.

8. Spell Checker using NLP
• Developed a spell checker that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to detect and correct spelling errors in text inputs.
• Implemented algorithms for word comparison against a comprehensive dictionary,
providing accurate correction suggestions.

• Enhanced the tool's accuracy by integrating machine learning models for context-
aware spell-checking.

• Demonstrated practical applications in text editing and communication, emphasizing
the significance of linguistic accuracy in various domains.
